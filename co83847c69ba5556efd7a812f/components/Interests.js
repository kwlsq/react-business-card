                Exploring my interests is like navigating different worlds! I'm passionate about anime and Japanese culture, fostering a growth mindset in everything I do. When not coding, you'll find me on the badminton court or immersed in the dynamic realms of hospitality and Food and Beverage. Life's a fascinating blend of tech, culture, and sports for me!</p>
